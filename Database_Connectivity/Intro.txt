Database Connectivity: It is the process of connecting to a database management system (DBMS) using Python code to perform operations like reading, writing, updating, and deleting data.

Q. How python and SQL will communicate with each other?
A) For this we will need a connector which will convert python code into SQL statements and vice versa.

Steps to connect to a database:
-> Load the driver class from the connector
-> create a connection with the database
-> create statements (SQL queries)
-> execute the statements
-> close the conection

Database Options:
1. Oracle
2. MySQL (recommended)
3. PostgreSQL
4. MongoDB (Schema-less DB)
