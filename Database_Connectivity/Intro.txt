Database Connectivity: It is the process of connecting to a database management system (DBMS) using Python code to perform operations like reading, writing, updating, and deleting data.

Q. How python and SQL will communicate with each other?
A) For this we will need a connector which will convert python code into SQL statements and vice versa.

Steps to connect to a database:
-> Connect with the MySQL Server
-> Create a connection with the existing database or create a new database
-> Create the SQL query to execute
-> Execute the Query (return the data if the query returns anything)
-> Close the connection

Database Options:
1. Oracle
2. MySQL (recommended)
3. PostgreSQL
4. MongoDB (Schema-less DB)

CRUD Operations performed on Database:
1. Create/Insert Data
2. Retrieve/Get Data (all/specific row)
3. Update/Modify Data
4. Delete/Remove Data


To connect with the mysql server from out Termial/CMD:

-> mysql -u root -p (enter the password "root")

-- use the below step if youhaven'e created a database yet! otherwise skip this step
-> CREATE DATABASE db_name; (change the db_name with the actual database name)

-> USE db_name; (change the db_name with the actual database name)


Now for the connector, we have python package installer (pip). to install the connector we have to type in a command in cmd.

pip install mysql-connector-python
