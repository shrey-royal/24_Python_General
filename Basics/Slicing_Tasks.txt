Paragraph: 
Indian cuisine offers a rich and diverse array of vegetarian dishes, reflecting the country's cultural and regional variations. Staples like lentils, rice, and a variety of fresh vegetables form the foundation of many meals. Dishes such as dal (lentil stew), sabzi (vegetable curry), and roti (unleavened bread) are commonplace. Spices play a crucial role, with ingredients like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala imparting unique flavors. South Indian cuisine features dishes like dosa (fermented crepe), idli (steamed rice cakes), and sambar (spicy lentil soup). North Indian cuisine is famous for dishes like paneer tikka (grilled cheese), chole (chickpea curry), and aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry). Street foods such as samosas, bhel puri, and pav bhaji are popular across the country. Many Indian sweets, including gulab jamun, jalebi, and barfi, are also vegetarian. Each region offers its own specialties, ensuring a vast and exciting culinary landscape for vegetarians to explore.
